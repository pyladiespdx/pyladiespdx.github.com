Welcome to Pyladies PDX!
=========================
<p class="site-description">PyLadies PDX is a professional and social group for women who are Python programmers at every experience level. We hold workshops and other events for primarily woman-identified developers on weekdays, and we welcome all to get together and hack and/or chat every Saturday at 11am. We are part of the larger PyLadies organization, and as such are a nonprofit under the umbrella of the Python Software Foundation.</p>

All events are organized through [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-PDX)
