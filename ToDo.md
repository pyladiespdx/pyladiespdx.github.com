I created this to do list to get the conversation started about improving this space. These are some of the ideas that have come up at Saturday Hackathons

### To Do (things that should proabably happen)
* Make the main Pyladies page link here
* Page of links to external resources 
* Page to list the resources that PDX PyLadies have created
	* Pdfs or webpages?
	* These may be reposted on the national site
* Migrate resources from Meetup
* Blog for short news-type posts to describe upcoming events (RSS)
* Create a space for lightning talk slides and notes (maybe on the resources page)

### Wishlist (things we might want to talk about doing)
* Bios for individual PyLadies
* Setup MailChimp (or something similar) to keep subscribers updates about upcoming events
* Calendar of upcoming workshops
