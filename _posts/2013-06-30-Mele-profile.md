bio: My name is Mele, and I'm a Technical Support Engineer at Urban Airship. Formerly, I worked at TriMet on the multimodal map trip planner. I spend most of my free time making web maps, playing with open data and open source tools, and riding my bike. I love how Python can help me manipulate geographic data exactly how I want without having to pay for expensive proprietary tools.
