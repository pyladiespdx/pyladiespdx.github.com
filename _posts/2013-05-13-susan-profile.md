bio: I'm a front end developer who is looking to learn more programming, currently working on JavaScript and Python. My first love is CSS and markup, especially in terms of reusability, accessiblity and clean code. In the last year I've devled more into OOCSS and SMACSS to make large sites CSS smaller and more reusable. I'm currently being mentored in learning JavaScript so that I can take my front end abilities even further. I found learning basic Python helpful in all of this. When I'm not on a computer I am reading, cooking, practicing yoga and chanting, or just hanging on my porch with a glass of wine.
