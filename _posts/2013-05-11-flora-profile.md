bio: My name is Flora, and I'm co-Organizer of PyLadiesPDX. I'm currently programming intern at The Open Bastion, where I work on Django-based software that powers open source conferences. I also contribute to OpenHatch and enjoy creating educational content for other new(ish) programmers. I'm a former academic with a MA in Cultural Studies, and completed a certificate in front end development before discovering a love for Python.
