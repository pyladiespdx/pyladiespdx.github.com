This is a 3-5 sentence explanation of your chosen tech term (say, 'VCS'--version control, or static site generator, etc).

These are links to a maximum of 3 tutorials or other educational materials that you have used successfully to understand and/or implement your tech term. (ie, links to any tutorial, blog post, video, etc. that has helped you in the past)

These are 3-5 links to tools/libraries that are relevant to your term (ie, if your term is "git", you might link to the official git site, the official github site, and to the bitbucket site.)

All of this needs to be written in Markdown!
