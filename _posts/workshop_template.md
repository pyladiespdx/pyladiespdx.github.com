Your post text here in Markdown.

** Workshops are: materials and/or notes from an actual workshope we've given; recaps, videos, etc. PDF downloads are great too!

** Tutorials are: written walkthroughs of using a particular tool or library; how you learned ____; install walk-throughs; how-tos, etc.

** Lightening talks are: talk that you gave in front of our group or in front of another group; posting about a longer talk in abbreviated form is also welcome.
