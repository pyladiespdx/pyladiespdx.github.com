<h1>Welcome to Pyladies PDX!</h1>
<p class="site-description">PyLadies PDX is a professional and social group for women who are Python programmers at every experience level. We hold workshops and other events for primarily woman-identified developers every 1st and 3rd Wednesday at 6pm, and we welcome all to get together and hack every Saturday at 11am. We are part of the larger PyLadies organization, and as such are a nonprofit under the umbrella of the Python Software Foundation.</p>
